# iParl integration for CiviCRM

This extension works with [Organic Campaigns' iParl service](http://www.organiccampaigns.com/). That service allows people to email their MPs (MEPs, etc.).

Once set-up, people taking action through iParl will have their detailed entered
in your CiviCRM database along with an activity recording that they took action.

It requires a fair bit of set-up between your CiviCRM and your Organic Campaigns
account, including some manual "oh, would you mind setting this up please
Organic Campaigns?", "No, not a problem" sort of non-technical stuff.

## Installing the extension

You'll need a functioning iParl account before starting.

Install the extension in the normal way. A pop-up will tell you to go to
`civicrm/admin/iparl` to configure things. That page has the instructions.
